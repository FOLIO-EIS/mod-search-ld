## Introduction

FOLIO search project.

## Building

### Running integration tests

The module uses [Testcontainers](https://www.testcontainers.org/) to run Elasticsearch in embedded mode.
It is required to have Docker installed and available on the host where the tests are executed.

## Multi-language search support

Each tenant is allowed to pick up to **5** languages from pre-installed list for multi-language indexes (e.g. title, contributors, etc.).
This can be done via following API:
`POST /search/config/languages`
```javascript
{
  "code":"eng"
}
```

The `code` here is an ISO-639-2/B three-letter code. Here is the list of pre-installed languages analyzers:
- ara
- ger
- eng
- spa
- fre
- heb
- ita
- jpn
- kor
- rus
- swe
- chi

## Deploying

The module uses system user to communicate with other modules from Kafka consumers.
For production deployments you MUST specify the password for this system user via env variable:
`SYSTEM_USER_PASSWORD=<password>`.
