## Introduction

FOLIO search project.

## Building

### Running integration tests

The module uses [Testcontainers](https://www.testcontainers.org/) to run Elasticsearch in embedded mode.
It is required to have Docker installed and available on the host where the tests are executed.

## Multi-language search support

Each tenant is allowed to pick up to **5** languages from pre-installed list for multi-language indexes (e.g. title, contributors, etc.).
This can be done via following API:
`POST /search/config/languages`
```javascript
{
  "code":"eng"
}
```

The `code` here is an ISO-639-2/B three-letter code. Here is the list of pre-installed languages analyzers:
- ara
- ger
- eng
- spa
- fre
- heb
- ita
- jpn
- kor
- rus
- swe
- chi

### Adding new languages via REST

It is allowed to add new languages via rest endpoint `/search/config/languages`.
**Please note, when you add a new language, a whole reindex is required in order to
apply new configuration**.

### Defining initial languages via ENV variable

It is possible to define initial languages via `INITIAL_LANGUAGES` env variable.
These languages will be added on tenant init and applied to index. Example usage:
`INITIAL_LANGUAGES=eng,fre,kor,chi,spa`. If the variable is not defined, only
`eng` code is added.

## Deploying

The module uses system user to communicate with other modules from Kafka consumers.
For production deployments you MUST specify the password for this system user via env variable:
`SYSTEM_USER_PASSWORD=<password>`.

### Configuring connection to elasticsearch

In order to configure connection to elasticsearch you have to provide following env variables:
* `ELASTICSEARCH_HOST` - host name of the elasticsearch master node (e.g. elasticsearch);
* `ELASTICSEARCH_PORT` - REST port of the elasticsearch master node (9200 by default);
* `ELASTICSEARCH_USERNAME` - username of the user to connect to elasticsearch;
* `ELASTICSEARCH_PASSWORD` - password for the user (see
  [official guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/configuring-security.html)
  for more details about ES security).
